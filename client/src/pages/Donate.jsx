        </h1>
        <p>
          Our non-profit foundation is entirely reliant on corporate and private
          donors to finance the programmes and goal of providing less fortunate
          children with the comfort, care, and treatment of a home, as well as
          the promise of a better future. It is impossible for us to continue
          the work that weâ€™re doing without your help. Your donation will ensure
          a positive impact on the livelihoods of children and young people in
          Malaysia, as well as guaranteeing the sustainability of our
          organization so that we may continue to help the little ones secure
          happy, healthy futures.
